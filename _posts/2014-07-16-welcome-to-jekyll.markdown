Finally making some progress migrating whatever I could salvage from textdrive.

There's a bunch of changes underlying this new site. I've converted to using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [github](http://github.com). All source control is done through git. I have a few mirrors of my git repos now. Hosting is now being handled by [linode](http://linode.com) vs. textdrive. I really love the linode setup, monitoring and management. The prices are a bit more but I get a full VM that I can manage myself. I lost almost all of my content in the textdrive shutdown. Still hoping to get that back but it might not ever be recovered. Some of my larger personal projects I have archived copies of and have been migrating from svn to git. There's a lot to do to get things back up but it's a good excuse to modernize and move forward.
